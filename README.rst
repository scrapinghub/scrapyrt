HTTP server which provides API for scheduling Scrapy spiders and
making requests with spiders.

Allows you to easily add HTTP API to your existing Scrapy project. All Scrapy project
components (e.g. middleware, pipelines, extensions) are supported out of the box. You
simply run Scrapyrt in Scrapy project directory and it starts HTTP server allowing you 
to schedule your spiders and get spider output in JSON format.
